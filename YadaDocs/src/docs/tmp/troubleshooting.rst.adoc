.When something doesn't work as expected


==  Runtime problems



===  Application doesn't start



Clear compilation errors:: 

The application won't work properly if you have compilation errors in your sources. Fix them first.



Check the stack trace:: 

Be sure to set a high limit on the console output ("Windows > Preferences > Run/Debug > Console > Limit console output")
so that the log is not clipped. Look for the first stack trace and see the root reason for the problem. This should help you a lot.







===  Can't see the changes


If you made some change in the code but the site seems to ignore them, these are the steps you could take, in order of annoyance.


Be sure you saved the file:: 

This is trivial but sometimes you might forget.



Refresh the sources:: 

Eclipse should detect changes in the source files automatically, but sometimes a "Refresh" helps (F5 on a folder in Package Explorer).



Force a "publish" on Tomcat:: 

Ususally Tomcat copies modified items to the deploy directory automatically. Sometimes you have to force it using the "Publish" context menu on the server.



Restart Tomcat:: 

When "Publish" doesn't do the trick, try with a restart of the server.



Force a "clean" on Tomcat:: 

The "Clean..." context menu on the server deletes the application files from the deploy directory and publishes them again.



Remove and add back the web application:: 

Using the "Add and remove..." context menu on the server, remove the web application, restart Tomcat, add the application back, restart again.
This should be similar to "Clean..." but sometimes it works better.



Physically delete the deploy files on disk:: 

Sometimes Eclipse can't copy a file for some reason. In such cases you should do it manually: stop Tomcat, open the deploy folder
and delete everything inside wtpwebapps (you might keep ROOT). Then do a "Publish..." on the server.
If you can't delete a file because it's locked, you might need to close Eclipse or restart the PC.







==  Compilation problems



===  Errors for no reason


When you start Eclipse again after some time, it might give you compilation errors that weren't there the last time.


Perform a Gradle Refresh:: 

From the context menu on a project, use "Gradle > Refresh Gradle Project".
This usually fixes everything and also downloads the latest versions of the libraries you are using, so it's worth doing it every now and then.



Clean and Build:: 

The Gradle Refresh should rebuild your project, but maybe you need to clean them first. Use the "Project > Clean..." menu
from the top bar.







===  Errors after a git pull


Always be sure to have the correct YadaFramework version. Choose a specific branch and stick to it until you are ready
to switch to a more recent one. Never use the master because the API might change without notice.
