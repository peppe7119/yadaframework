=  Database Pagination
:docinfo: shared

Fetch big data one piece at a time

==  Description


Loading the whole content of a table onto a web page is never a good idea if the row count is high, both
from a performance and usability perspective.
In such case it's better to implement database pagination: loading a few rows at a time via ajax when the user wants
to see more.
This section shows how to implement pagination on a web page using a "load more" button, with support
for bookmarking and for the
browser back button: when going back to a web page where more data was loaded, that data is still there.


==  First query


The "first query" happens when a user loads the web page for the first time, either from normal link navigation
(e.g. a "Show all transactions" link) or by typing a search string into a form and sending it.
The first query will receive any search keywords, will query the database for results, and will return the
results building a page with a "load more" button when there is more data to show.

The "first query" is also called when the user later reloads the web page using the browser "refresh" button,
using the browser "back" button or by clicking on a previously saved bookmark.

It is therefore important that the method handling the first query receives the information needed to load
as many rows as were loaded by the user using the "load more" button. This information is stored in a `YadaPageRequest`:

[source,html]
----
<form th:action="@{/searchBook(sort='title,asc,ignorecase',sort='date,desc')}"> # <1>
	<input name="searchString" th:value="${searchString}">
	<button type="submit">
----
<1> The action in this example contains the sort parameters

[source,java]
----
@Controller
public class BookController {
    final static int PAGE_SIZE =  10;
    @RequestMapping("/searchBook")
    public String searchBook(String searchString, YadaPageRequest yadaPageRequest, Model model) {
----

When the web page is loaded for the first time, Spring calls the "first query" method and creates an instance of
YadaPageRequest but doesn't set any values in it because there are no request parameters to set.
You should check if the yadaPageRequest is valid and set it to a default initial value when it's not,
then call the proper DAO to fetch data from the database, that will be stored in a `YadaPageRows` instance:

[source,java]
----
if (!yadaPageRequest.isValid()) {
    yadaPageRequest = new YadaPageRequest(0, PAGE_SIZE);
    yadaPageRequest.addSort("title", false, true);
    yadaPageRequest.addSort("date", true, false);
}
YadaPageRows<Book> result = searchDao.find(searchString, yadaPageRequest);
model.addAttribute("books", result);
return "/searchResult";
----

The DAO will have to fetch as many rows as needed:

[source,java]
----
@Repository
@Transactional(readOnly = true)
public class SearchDao {
    @PersistenceContext EntityManager em;

    public YadaPageRows<Book> find(String searchString, YadaPageRequest yadaPageRequest) {
        List<Book> found = YadaSql.instance().selectFrom("from Book b")
            .where("b.title LIKE CONCAT('%',:search,'%')")
            .orderBy(yadaPageRequest)
            .setParameter("search", searchString)
            .query(em, Book.class)
            .setFirstResult(yadaPageRequest.getFirstResult())
            .setMaxResults(yadaPageRequest.getMaxResults())
            .getResultList();
        return new YadaPageRows<Book>(found, yadaPageRequest);
    }
----

It is very important to use the `setFirstResult` and `setMaxResults` methods as shown above in order to
implement pagination.

The result can be shown with the following `searchResult.html`:

[source,html]
----
<th:block fragment="bookList" th:unless="${books.empty}">
	<div th:each="book : ${books}" th:text="${book.title}">Book title here</div>

	<div class="jsLoadMoreBooks" th:unless="${books.last}">
    	<a yada:ajax="@{/searchBookMore(searchString=${searchString},page=${books.nextPage},size=${books.pageSize})}"
        	yada:paginationHistory
            yada:updateOnSuccess="yadaParents:.jsLoadMoreBooks" href="">Load More
        </a>
    </div>
</th:block>
----


==  Load More query


The above code prints the found rows, then adds a "Load More" link in case there are more results.
When the user clicks on that link, an ajax call is made to the server in order to fetch the next page:

[source,java]
----
@RequestMapping("/searchBookMore")
public String searchBookMore(String searchString, YadaPageRequest yadaPageRequest, Model model) {
    YadaPageRows<Book> result = searchDao.find(searchString, yadaPageRequest);
    model.addAttribute("books", result);
    return "/searchResult :: bookList";
}
----

That's all there is to it.

The `YadaPageRows.isLast()` method works automatically with no need for an expensive count query:
the `YadaPageRequest` will try to fetch one row more than the page size in order to tell
if there are more results to fetch.

The `yada:paginationHistory` attribute, with no value, will add the `page`, `size` and `loadPrevious` request
parameters to the current page URL in the history, so that when using a bookmark, reloading the page or using
the back button those values will be sent to the "first query" method seen at the start, and all
pages up to the current one will be fetched from database and shown. The `yada:paginationHistory` attribute
must be set on the link or button that loads the next page.

==  Advanced Usage

This example can be optimized by using a single method both for the first query and for the following ones,
and many paginations can be used on a single web page by keeping distinct `yada:paginationHistory` parameters, 
like `yada:paginationHistory="'product.page, product.size, product.loadPrevious'"` and `yada:paginationHistory="'project.page, project.size, project.loadPrevious'"`.

To use the same method for the first query and the loadMore ones, just check if the request is ajax
in order to return either the full initial web page or the pagination fragment:

[source,java]
----
public String searchBook(String searchString, YadaPageRequest yadaPageRequest, Model model) {
	...
	return yadaWebUtil.isAjaxRequest() ? "/searchResult :: bookList" : "/searchResult";
